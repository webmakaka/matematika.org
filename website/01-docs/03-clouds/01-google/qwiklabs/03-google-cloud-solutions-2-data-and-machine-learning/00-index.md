# Google Cloud Solutions II: Data and Machine Learning

https://www.qwiklabs.com/quests/38

In this advanced-level quest, you will learn how to harness serious GCP computing power to run big data and machine learning jobs. The hands-on labs will give you use cases, and you will be tasked with implementing big data and machine learning practices utilized by Googleâ€™s very own Solutions Architecture team. From running Big Query analytics on tens of thousands of basketball games, to training TensorFlow image classifiers, you will quickly see why GCP is the go-to platform for running big data and machine learning jobs.
