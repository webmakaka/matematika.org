# Intermediate ML: TensorFlow on GCP

https://google.qwiklabs.com/quests/83

TensorFlow is library for is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation that's great for writing models that can train and run on platforms ranging from your laptop to a fleet of servers in the Cloud to an edge device. This quest takes you beyond the basics of using predefined models and teaches you how to build, train and deploy your own on GCP.
